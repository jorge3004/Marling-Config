‚ûï ADD : CTO Birthday Countdown

üìé Task : https://github.com/LeftFieldAdam/countdown

‚ùì Why : 

* For having a back-up of what has been done until now in this evaluation.
* To presenting some advances to the evaluator.
* To implementing some of the tasks requested by the evaluator. 

üí° How :

* Pushing the initial commit as a a first feature according to repo instructions.
* Including the mean task solved in the most efficient possible way, at least in my opinion.
* Replacing class based components for functional based ones because they are my strongest technology.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Sides effects:

* Tests cases are still in process of being updated.
* PWA is still in process of being generated.
* README file is still in process of being changed.
